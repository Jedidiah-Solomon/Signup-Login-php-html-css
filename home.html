		<h2>What I do as a Web Developer</h2>
		<p>Web developers create and maintain websites. They are also responsible for the site's technical aspects, such as its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the site can handle. In addition, web developers may create content for the site.</p>
		<p>	Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, 
			or for a 	private network known as an intranet.

			Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.

			From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS)—all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by developers.
